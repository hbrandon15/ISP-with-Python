# ISP with Python

This repository is based on the course **Python for Signal and Image Processing Master Class** by Dr. Zeeshan.  
It supports my pivot from fullstack development to ISP, leveraging my background in photography.

## About the Course
- Instructor: Dr. Zeeshan
- Focus: Python for signal and image processing, with hands-on projects and real-world applications.

## Purpose
- Document my learning and progress through the course
- Apply ISP techniques to real-world and photography-related problems
- Build a portfolio of relevant projects and notebooks

## Contents
- `main.py`: Main script for experiments and code samples
- `Numpy-deep-dive.ipynb`: NumPy exercises and explorations
- `Plotting-and-visualization.ipynb`: Visualization and plotting techniques
- `Program1.ipynb`: Course assignments and hands-on projects
- `readMe.md`: This documentation

## Key Learning Areas
- Signal processing fundamentals (filtering, transforms, etc.)
- Image processing (enhancement, restoration, segmentation)
- Python libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, SciPy, and more
- Visualization and analysis of signals and images
- Applying ISP concepts to photography

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
	```
	git clone https://github.com/hbrandon15/ISP-with-Python.git
	```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
	```
	python -m venv .venv
	.\.venv\Scripts\activate
	```
3. Install dependencies:
	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
4. Open notebooks in VS Code or JupyterLab.

## Why ISP?
With a foundation in photography, I am passionate about the science behind digital images and signals.  
This course and repository are part of my journey to:
- Deepen my technical expertise in ISP
- Transition my career from fullstack to ISP
- Combine creative and analytical skills
